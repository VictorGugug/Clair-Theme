# Clair

Spicetify theme with an animated cover art background behind the whole app and glass panels.

The name is the idea: **Clair** is French for *clear*, from Latin *clarus*: bright, plain and loud, one word for light and for sound, and the same root as English *clear* and *clarity*. Clair keeps the app clear so your own artwork and wallpaper stay in view.

- **Light** (default) or **Dark**: bright cover colors with see-through panels, or dimmed colors with deeper panels. Blur, Warp, Motion, Saturation and Brightness stay adjustable.
- **Sync with Spicy Lyrics**: shown only when Spicy Lyrics is installed. When on, Clair uses the Spicy Lyrics background (same shader, blur, saturation, dithering, brightness filter and tempo/beat speed) and follows its settings live, including the static Auto, Artist Header, Cover Art and Color modes and blur. The background is mapped onto the lyrics panel exactly like Spicy draws it, so the lyrics page and the rest of the app form one continuous background. **Background motion** in the Background tab still freezes it, which also stops its render loop.

The accent follows the current cover through the same Spotify dynamic colors (`getDynamicColorsByUris`) that Spicy Lyrics uses.

## Install from Marketplace

Open Spicetify Marketplace, go to Themes, search for **Clair** and click Install. To use Sync with Spicy Lyrics, also install the Spicy Lyrics extension from Marketplace.

## Install manually (Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\INSTALL.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\INSTALL.ps1 -Scheme Clair-OLED
```

The installer runs `spicetify backup` first and moves any previous copy of the theme to `Clair.bak-<timestamp>`.

## Settings

Click the gear button next to your avatar (top right). The window uses the same layout as the Spicy Lyrics settings: a sidebar with the theme name, a search box and four main tabs, then Experiments and About below a divider, and a pane of grouped cards.

| Tab | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Appearance | Light (default) or Dark under Style, then Material: Panel opacity, Glass blur, Corner radius |
| Background | Background on or off, Sync with Spicy Lyrics (when installed; shows its current background and a button to open its settings) and Background motion, otherwise Blur, Warp, Motion, Saturation, Brightness |
| Color | Accent (cover art, presets or custom), Custom color, Surface tint |
| More | Window controls (Default, Clair, or No controls), Minimal mode (hides friend activity), Maximum performance, Reset |
| Experiments | clair-perf status and on/off switch, opt-in live monitor when the extension is installed, Instant UI, Optimize to the max |
| About | Theme version, repository and issue tracker links, and the independence note |

The search box filters rows on every tab and dims the tabs with no match.

Hold the eye button in the header to step the whole window aside and look at the app behind it.

Changes apply instantly and persist. Console: `ClairTheme.openSettings()`, `ClairTheme.version`.

## Performance

The performance governor is a separate extension: `clair-perf` at `https://github.com/VictorGugug/clair-perf`. It watches frame pacing, lowers the glass blur only when Spotify is actually dropping frames, and restores it after the app is smooth again.

Install it from its repository with its own `INSTALL.ps1`. Clair detects it and adds an **Experiments** tab with the on/off switch and an opt-in live monitor (FPS, p90 frame time, JS heap, time spent in each level). The console API is `ClairPerf.report()` and `ClairPerf.set('auto' | 'off' | 'lite' | 'low')`.

The same tab has **Instant UI** and **Optimize to the max**: still background, no glass blur and no hover or page transitions, while keeping the colors.

Clair itself avoids scroll-linked work: the animated artist header no longer runs a scroll timeline, artist pages use the route instead of a `:has()` on the main view, the background stops when Spotify loses focus, and the WebGL loop is capped at 30 fps and stops entirely at Background motion 0. The only deliberately expensive effect left is the `clair-glass` backdrop blur; Glass blur 0 removes it, and the governor can lower it temporarily without touching your setting.

## Uninstall

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\UNINSTALL.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\UNINSTALL.ps1 -FullRestore
```

After a Spotify update breaks styling: `spicetify restore backup apply`, then `spicetify backup apply`.

## Schemes

`Clair-Dark` (default) and `Clair-OLED` (pure black). Their `button` color is the fallback accent when cover colors are unavailable.

## About

Version 1.1.2, also shown in Settings under About.

Clair is an independent theme. It is not official, and it is not associated or affiliated with Spicy Lyrics. Spicy Lyrics is a separate project by its own authors; Clair only reads its settings when Sync is on.
